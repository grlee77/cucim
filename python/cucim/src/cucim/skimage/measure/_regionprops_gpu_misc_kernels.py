    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : (M, N) ndarray
        Binary input image.
    neighborhood : 4 or 8, optional

        the perimeter is computed.

        will be computed internally.

    Returns
    -------
    perimeter : float
        Total perimeter of all objects in binary image.

    Notes
    -----
    The `perimeter` method does not consider the boundary along the image edge
    as image as part of the perimeter, while the `perimeter_crofton` method
    does. In any case, an object touching the image edge likely extends outside
    of the field of view, so an accurate perimeter cannot be measured for such
    objects.

    TODO(grelee): should be able to make this faster with a customized
    filter/kernel instead of convolve + bincount, etc.

    Notes
    -----
    This measure is based on Crofton formula [1], which is a measure from
    integral geometry. It is defined for general curve length evaluation via
    a double integral along all directions. In a discrete
    space, 2 or 4 directions give a quite good approximation, 4 being more
    accurate than 2 for more complex shapes.

    Similar to :func:`~.measure.perimeter`, this function returns an
    approximation of the perimeter in continuous space.

    The `perimeter` method does not consider the boundary along the image edge
    as image as part of the perimeter, while the `perimeter_crofton` method
    does. In any case, an object touching the image edge likely extends outside
    of the field of view, so an accurate perimeter cannot be measured for such
    objects.

    Returns
    -------
    euler_number : cp.ndarray of int
        Euler characteristic of the set of all objects in the image.

    Notes
    -----
    The Euler characteristic is an integer number that describes the
    topology of the set of all objects in the input image. If object is
    4-connected, then background is 8-connected, and conversely.

    The computation of the Euler characteristic is based on an integral
    geometry formula in discretized space. In practice, a neighborhood
    configuration is constructed, and a LUT is applied for each
    configuration. The coefficients used are the ones of Ohser et al.

    It can be useful to compute the Euler characteristic for several
    connectivities. A large relative difference between results
    for different connectivities suggests that the image resolution
    (with respect to the size of objects and holes) is too low.
