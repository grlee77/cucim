# How auditwheel repair works?
#
# From https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/3.2.0/auditwheel/wheel_abi.py#L38
# 1) Find a Python extension libraries(.so)
#      if so ==> A, else ==> B
# 2) `needed_libs` <== external libraries needed by A and B
# 3) From b in B,
#      if b is not in `needed_libs`, b is added to A
# 4) Only external libraries in A are patched to use locally copied .so files
#    - external libraries that exists under wheel path are discarded
#      - https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/3.2.0/auditwheel/policy/external_references.py#L61
#    - https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/3.2.0/auditwheel/repair.py#L62
#
# With current implementation,
# - `cucim/_cucim.cpython-XX-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` files are in A by 1)
# - `cucim/libcucim.so.??` is in B by 1)
# - `cucim/libcucim.so.??` and `libcudart.so.11.0` are in `needed_libs` by 2)
# - `cucim/cucim.kit.cuslide@??.??.??.so` is in A by 3)
#
# And only libz and libcudart are considered as external libraries.

# To work with cuCIM, we need to
# 1) make `cucim/libcucim.so.??` as Python extension library
#   - Patch elf_is_python_extension : https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/3.2.0/auditwheel/elfutils.py#L81
# 2) control how to copy external libraries
#   - Patch copylib: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/3.2.0/auditwheel/repair.py#L108
#   - Need for libnvjpeg library
# 3) preprocess wheel metadata
#   - patch InWheelCtx.__enter__ : https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/3.2.0/auditwheel/wheeltools.py#L158
#   - `Root-Is-Purelib: true` -> `Root-Is-Purelib: false` from WHEEL file
